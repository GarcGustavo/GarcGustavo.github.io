   Today students presented their petri-nets homework. Afterwards we discussed message and live sequence charts, which is a way of visually representing instances on which events are specified. Instances are an abstract entity so events can have a range of types.

   Today's class was focused on petri nets, a tool used for visually  representing concurrency through modeling. Petri nets are usually composed of graphical symbols representing states, transitions and links/arrows between them. States can be either places or conditions and transitions can be events. We also discussed the different basic types of petri nets, such as CEN, PTN and CPNs.

   This week's topic is modularization. I presented the first question, got some feedback on my use of Unit in defining axioms. Modularization itself is akin to bringing OOP to RSL space by defining schemes and objects from classes, when you wrap classes as schemes you can use them as objects in other areas. Modularization basically allows you to simplify RSL specifications via the creation of schemes and objects to handle classes.

    Hello, my name is Gustavo Reyes. This is a personal blog where I will share select topics from my software engineering class, maybe some other stuff down the line too.
    For now I plan on keeping the blog as minimalist as possible, thanks for visiting and look forward to future posts. </p>
